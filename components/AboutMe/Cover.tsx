						I&apos;ve always enjoyed and been interested in implementing visual things. While learning and practicing
						Architecture, I realized the importance of visual organization and functionality, especially with the

						tools, smoothly falling into FrontEnd development that actually implements such a great UI UX.

						Currently, I&apos;m working on personal projects and learning Typescript and Algorithms with JavaScript to
